            <h1 className='text-2xl font-bold'>Question1: Tell us the differences between uncontrolled and controlled components.</h1>
            <p className='bg-slate-50 m-2 rounded-lg'>Answer1: Uncontrolled components refer to those parts of the application where the developer has little or no control over its behavior. Examples of uncontrolled components include the browser's native form elements such as input, textarea, and select. These elements are controlled by the browser and their behavior cannot be easily modified by the developer.</p>

            <p className='bg-slate-50 m-2 rounded-lg'>Answer3: Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to use JavaScript on the server-side, while Express.js is a web application framework built on top of Node.js that simplifies the process of building web applications.</p>

            <p className='bg-slate-50 m-2 rounded-lg'>
                Answer4: In React, a custom hook is a function that allows developers to extract reusable logic from a component and share it across multiple components. A custom hook is a JavaScript function that starts with the prefix "use" and typically uses other built-in React hooks to compose its behavior.
